# Restore Package

The `restore` package is a core Go package that handles XML restore operations in the Inventario application. It provides comprehensive functionality to restore inventory data from XML exports with support for multiple restore strategies, detailed logging, and background processing.

## Overview

The restore package is responsible for parsing XML export files and restoring inventory data back into the database. It supports multiple restore strategies to handle different scenarios, implements streaming approaches for large files, and provides detailed step-by-step logging of the restoration process.

## Key Features

### 1. Multiple Restore Strategies
- **Full Replace (Destructive)**: Wipes current database and restores everything from backup
- **Merge (Additive)**: Only adds data missing in current database (matched by primary key)
- **Merge (Update Existing)**: Creates if missing, updates if exists, leaves other records untouched

### 2. Streaming XML Processing
- Memory-efficient streaming approach for large XML files
- On-the-fly processing without loading entire files into memory
- Chunked decoding to handle massive inventories with embedded base64 data
- Real-time statistics collection during processing

### 3. Detailed Step Logging
- Comprehensive step-by-step logging of restoration process
- Emoji-based status indicators (üìù, üîÑ, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå, ‚è≠Ô∏è)
- Individual item processing logs showing what was checked, skipped, updated
- Real-time progress tracking with detailed action descriptions

### 4. File Data Restoration
- Restoration of binary file attachments (images, invoices, manuals)
- Base64 decoding and file recreation in blob storage
- Proper MIME type and extension handling
- Error resilience for corrupted or missing file data

### 5. Background Processing
- Worker-based architecture for asynchronous restoration
- Prevents API timeouts on large restore operations
- Semaphore-based concurrency control (only one restore at a time)
- Graceful error handling and status reporting

### 6. Dry Run Support
- Preview mode to see what would be restored without making changes
- Validation of XML structure and data integrity
- Conflict detection and resolution preview
- Safe testing of restore operations

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### RestoreService (`service.go`)
The main service responsible for restore operations:
- **RestoreFromXML()**: Main method that processes XML and restores data
- **ProcessRestoreOperation()**: Orchestrates background restore with logging
- **processRestoreWithDetailedLogging()**: Handles detailed step-by-step logging
- **validateOptions()**: Validates restore configuration options
- Supports multiple restore strategies with specialized processing methods

#### RestoreWorker (`worker.go`)
Background worker that manages restore processing:
- **Start()**: Begins processing restores in the background
- **Stop()**: Gracefully stops the restore worker
- **processPendingRestores()**: Finds and processes pending restore requests
- **processRestore()**: Processes individual restore operations
- Configurable poll intervals (default: 10 seconds)
- Semaphore-based concurrency limiting (max 1 concurrent restore)

#### XML Types (`types.go`)
Defines XML structure and conversion methods:
- **XMLInventory**: Root element containing all restore data
- **XMLLocation**, **XMLArea**, **XMLCommodity**: Entity representations
- **XMLFile**: File attachment structure with base64 data
- **RestoreStats**: Statistics tracking during restoration
- **RestoreOptions**: Configuration options for restore operations

#### Detailed Logging Components
- **LoggedRestoreService**: Service wrapper that adds detailed logging
- **DetailedRestoreProcessor**: Manages step-by-step logging and progress tracking
- **RestoreStep**: Individual step tracking with status and results

### Restore Strategies

#### Full Replace Strategy
```go
RestoreStrategyFullReplace
```
- **Behavior**: Clears entire database before restoration
- **Use Case**: Complete database replacement from backup
- **Risk**: All current data is lost
- **Validation**: Requires explicit confirmation

#### Merge Additive Strategy
```go
RestoreStrategyMergeAdditive
```
- **Behavior**: Only adds missing data, skips existing items
- **Use Case**: Adding new data from backup without conflicts
- **Risk**: Low - existing data remains unchanged
- **Matching**: Based on XML IDs and unique identifiers

#### Merge Update Strategy
```go
RestoreStrategyMergeUpdate
```
- **Behavior**: Creates missing items, updates existing ones
- **Use Case**: Synchronizing with updated backup data
- **Risk**: Medium - existing data may be overwritten
- **Matching**: Based on XML IDs with update capability

## Data Flow

### Standard Restore Process
1. **Request Creation**: User creates restore operation via API
2. **Record Storage**: Restore operation created with "pending" status
3. **Worker Detection**: RestoreWorker polls and detects pending operation
4. **Initialization**: RestoreService begins processing with initial logging
5. **XML Parsing**: Streaming XML parser processes file sections
6. **Data Processing**: Entities processed according to selected strategy
7. **File Restoration**: Binary files decoded and stored in blob storage
8. **Statistics Collection**: Real-time tracking of processed entities
9. **Completion**: Restore operation marked as completed with final statistics

### Detailed Logging Flow
1. **Step Creation**: Each major phase creates a restore step
2. **Progress Updates**: Steps updated with in-progress, success, or error status
3. **Item Logging**: Individual items logged with emoji indicators
4. **Action Prediction**: System predicts what action will be taken for each item
5. **Result Tracking**: Actual results compared with predictions
6. **Error Handling**: Failed items logged with detailed error messages

## Usage

### Creating a Restore Service
```go
import "github.com/denisvmedia/inventario/restore"

// Create restore service
service := restore.NewRestoreService(registrySet, uploadLocation)
```

### Starting the Restore Worker
```go
// Create worker with max 1 concurrent restore
worker := restore.NewRestoreWorker(restoreService, registrySet, uploadLocation, 1)

// Start background processing
ctx := context.Background()
worker.Start(ctx)

// Stop when done
defer worker.Stop()
```

### Processing a Restore Operation
```go
// Process restore operation by ID
err := service.ProcessRestoreOperation(ctx, restoreOperationID, uploadLocation)
if err != nil {
    log.Printf("Restore failed: %v", err)
}
```

### Restore Options Configuration
```go
options := restore.RestoreOptions{
    Strategy:        restore.RestoreStrategyMergeUpdate,
    IncludeFileData: true,
    DryRun:          false,
}

stats, err := service.RestoreFromXML(ctx, xmlReader, options)
```

## XML Processing

### Streaming Approach
The restore package uses a streaming XML parser to handle large files efficiently:

```go
decoder := xml.NewDecoder(reader)
for {
    tok, err := decoder.Token()
    if err == io.EOF {
        break
    }
    // Process tokens as they arrive
}
```

### Entity Processing Order
1. **Locations**: Processed first as they are referenced by areas
2. **Areas**: Processed second as they are referenced by commodities
3. **Commodities**: Processed last with full dependency resolution

### File Data Handling
- Base64 encoded data is decoded on-the-fly
- Files are streamed directly to blob storage
- MIME types and extensions are preserved
- Corrupted files are logged but don't stop the restore

## Error Handling

### Comprehensive Error Management
- **Graceful Degradation**: Individual item failures don't stop entire restore
- **Detailed Logging**: All errors logged with context and item information
- **Status Tracking**: Failed restores marked with detailed error messages
- **Rollback Support**: Dry run mode allows safe testing

### Error Recovery
- **Partial Success**: Statistics reflect successfully processed items
- **File Fallbacks**: Missing or corrupted files logged but restore continues
- **Validation Errors**: Data validation failures logged with specific field information
- **Dependency Resolution**: Missing dependencies handled gracefully

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Efficiency
- **Streaming Processing**: XML processed without loading entire file into memory
- **Chunked File Handling**: Large binary files processed in chunks
- **Real-time Statistics**: Statistics collected without memory accumulation
- **Garbage Collection**: Proper resource cleanup and memory management

### Concurrency Control
- **Single Restore Limit**: Only one restore operation allowed at a time
- **Semaphore Protection**: Prevents resource conflicts and data corruption
- **Background Processing**: Asynchronous processing prevents API timeouts
- **Worker Isolation**: Restore operations isolated from other system processes

## Testing
